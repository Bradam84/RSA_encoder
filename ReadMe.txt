This program was written to encrypt and decrypt discussion board messages as a part of Discrete Math.
The encryption method used in the RSA encryption used the public key (3:33) and the private key (7:33).
Prompts were added that allowed me or any future users to use a different key if needed. A user will
copy the message they would like to encrypt or decrypt into the appropriate text file. After running
the program and selecting the process the user wants the results are written to a result text file.
