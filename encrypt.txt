HI MICHAEL,
I HAVE WRITTEN A PYTHON PROGRAM TO DECODE AND ENCRYPT MESSAGES VERY QUICKLY.
I HAD AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET TO HANDLE IT BUT AFTER THINKING ABOUT IT DECIDED
THAT A PROGRAM WOULD WORK BETTER. USING EXCEL TOOK ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES TO
COPY THE TEXT AND DECODE THE ENTIRE MESSAGE, NOW THE PROGRAM TAKES TEN SECONDS.
